Iris Dataset Classification using Linear Regression

Project Overview
This project involves using the Iris dataset to perform classification using Linear Regression. 
The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in the field of machine learning and statistics. 
It contains measurements of four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) of 150 iris flowers from three different species (setosa, versicolor, and virginica).

Getting Started

Prerequisites
1. Python 3.7 or higher
2. Jupyter Notebook
3. Libraries listed in requirements.txt

Installation
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/iris-linear-regression.git

2. Install the required libraries:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Project Steps
1. Data Exploration: Explored the dataset to understand the features and target classes.
2. Data Preprocessing: Prepared the data by handling missing values, normalizing, and splitting into training and testing sets.
3. Model Development: Developed a linear regression model to classify the iris species.
4. Model Evaluation: Evaluated the model using appropriate metrics and visualize the results.
